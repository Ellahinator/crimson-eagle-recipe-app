# Foodly

Welcome to the Foodly repository. This repository contains the codebase for the Foodly Recipe App, a web-based application that allows users to browse and create delicious food recipes. 

The frontend is built with React and Next.js and the backend is developed with Rust and Rocket, with Diesel as the ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. This project was developed by members of the Crimson Eagle team. 

The Foodly Recipe App can be accessed [here](https://crimson-eagle-recipe-app1.vercel.app/).

As a member of the Crimson Eagle team, my primary contributions were focused on the backend development. I've also contributed to various frontend features and functionalities.
